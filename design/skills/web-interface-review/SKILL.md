name: web-interface-review
description: Lint-style review of UI code (HTML/CSS/JSX/TSX/Vue/Svelte) against ~100 concrete, checkable web-interface rules - focus states, forms, keyboard, touch, typography, content overflow, images/CLS, performance, i18n, dark mode, hydration, copy - with terse file:line findings. Use when asked to "review my UI", "check this component/page/diff for UX or UI issues", "audit the frontend", or before merging UI changes. For a formal WCAG 2.2 conformance audit with axe and a keyboard/screen-reader pass use accessibility-audit; for motion/animation feel use motion-craft; for visual craft and hierarchy of product UI use interface-design; for redesigning an existing site's look use redesign-existing-projects.

# Web Interface Review

> Adapted from [vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines](https://github.com/vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines) (MIT, (c) 2025 Vercel Labs), `command.md` pinned at commit `e3d624b`. The upstream `web-design-guidelines` skill fetches these rules at runtime; here they are embedded so the review works offline and reproducibly. Re-pin on upstream updates.

A fast, lint-like pass over UI **code**. Every rule below is checkable in source and has an obvious fix. Findings are reported as clickable `file:line` entries - no essays.

## When to use

- Reviewing a component, page, or diff for UI/UX defects before merge
- "Check my site against best practices", "review my UI", "audit this form/modal/table"
- As the code-level companion to `interface-design` (visual craft) and `accessibility-audit` (formal WCAG conformance)

**Not for:** pixel-level visual critique (use `interface-design` or `redesign-existing-projects`), animation feel (use `motion-craft`), or a conformance claim (use `accessibility-audit` - passing this review is *not* WCAG conformance).

## How to run it

1. **Scope.** Use the files, glob, or diff the user named. If nothing was named, review the UI files changed on the current branch (`git diff --name-only` against the base branch); if there is no diff, ask which files.
2. **Read** each file fully. Note the stack (plain HTML/CSS, React/Next, Vue, Svelte, Tailwind). Rules marked React / Next / Tailwind only apply to that stack; translate the intent for others.
3. **Check** every applicable rule below. Flag only what you can point to in the code; do not speculate about runtime behavior you cannot see. The "Content & Copy" casing/wording rules are Vercel house style: when the project has its own style guide (e.g. sentence case), that guide wins.
4. **Report** in the output format at the end. Skip explanation unless the fix is non-obvious.
5. For the long-form MUST / SHOULD / NEVER version of the guidelines (adds layout, feedback, performance-measurement and design-polish rules not checkable from a single file), read [references/guidelines-must-should.md](references/guidelines-must-should.md).

## Rules

### Accessibility

- Icon-only buttons need `aria-label`
- Form controls need `<label>` or `aria-label`
- Interactive elements need keyboard handlers (`onKeyDown`/`onKeyUp`)
- `<button>` for actions, `<a>`/`<Link>` for navigation (not `<div onClick>`)
- Images need `alt` (or `alt=""` if decorative)
- Decorative icons need `aria-hidden="true"`
- Async updates (toasts, validation) need `aria-live="polite"`
- Use semantic HTML (`<button>`, `<a>`, `<label>`, `<table>`) before ARIA
- Headings hierarchical `<h1>`–`<h6>`; include skip link for main content
- `scroll-margin-top` on heading anchors
- Meaningful media needs captions, transcripts, or descriptions as applicable
- Media controls need keyboard support; decorative media needs assistive-tech hiding

### Focus States

- Interactive elements need visible focus: `:focus-visible` style (Tailwind: `focus-visible:ring-*`) or equivalent
- Never `outline-none` / `outline: none` without focus replacement
- Use `:focus-visible` over `:focus` (avoid focus ring on click)
- Group focus with `:focus-within` for compound controls
- Sticky headers/footers/overlays must not cover the focused element

### Forms

- Inputs need `autocomplete` and meaningful `name`
- Use correct `type` (`email`, `tel`, `url`, `number`) and `inputmode`
- Never block paste (`onPaste` + `preventDefault`)
- Labels clickable (`htmlFor` or wrapping control)
- Disable spellcheck on emails, codes, usernames (`spellcheck="false"`; React: `spellCheck={false}`)
- Checkboxes/radios: label + control share single hit target (no dead zones)
- Submit button stays enabled until request starts; spinner during request
- Errors inline next to fields; focus first error on submit
- Placeholders end with `…` and show example pattern
- `autocomplete="off"` on non-auth fields to avoid password manager triggers
- Warn before navigation with unsaved changes (`beforeunload` or router guard)

### Animation

- Honor `prefers-reduced-motion` (provide reduced variant or disable)
- Animate `transform`/`opacity` only (compositor-friendly)
- Never `transition: all`—list properties explicitly
- Set correct `transform-origin`
- SVG: transforms on `<g>` wrapper with `transform-box: fill-box; transform-origin: center`
- Animations interruptible—respond to user input mid-animation
- Autoplay motion >5 seconds alongside other content needs pause, stop, or hide controls
- Muted decorative loops must stop under `prefers-reduced-motion`

### Typography

- `…` not `...`
- Curly quotes `“` `”` not straight `"`
- Non-breaking spaces: `10&nbsp;MB`, `⌘&nbsp;K`, brand names
- Loading states end with `…`: `"Loading…"`, `"Saving…"`
- `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` for number columns/comparisons
- Use `text-wrap: balance` or `text-pretty` on headings (prevents widows)

### Content Handling

- Text containers handle long content: `truncate`, `line-clamp-*`, or `break-words`
- Flex children need `min-w-0` to allow text truncation
- Handle empty states—don't render broken UI for empty strings/arrays
- User-generated content: anticipate short, average, and very long inputs

### Images

- `<img>` needs explicit `width` and `height` (prevents CLS)
- Below-fold images: `loading="lazy"`
- Above-fold critical images: `fetchpriority="high"` (Next.js: `priority`)

### Performance

- Large lists (>50 items): virtualize (`virtua`, `content-visibility: auto`)
- No layout reads in render (`getBoundingClientRect`, `offsetHeight`, `offsetWidth`, `scrollTop`)
- Batch DOM reads/writes; avoid interleaving
- Prefer uncontrolled inputs; controlled inputs must be cheap per keystroke
- Add `<link rel="preconnect">` for CDN/asset domains
- Critical fonts: `<link rel="preload" as="font">` with `font-display: swap`
- Prefer `<video autoplay muted loop playsinline>` over animated GIF; provide a still alternative
- Short non-essential loops: Safari H.264 MP4 `<picture>` source, `prefers-reduced-motion` media condition, and still fallback

### Navigation & State

- URL reflects state—filters, tabs, pagination, expanded panels in query params
- Links use `<a>`/`<Link>` (Cmd/Ctrl+click, middle-click support)
- Deep-link all stateful UI (React: if it uses `useState`, consider URL sync via nuqs or similar)
- Destructive actions need confirmation modal or undo window—never immediate

### Touch & Interaction

- `touch-action: manipulation` (prevents double-tap zoom delay)
- `-webkit-tap-highlight-color` set intentionally
- `overscroll-behavior: contain` in modals/drawers/sheets
- During drag: disable text selection, `inert` on dragged elements
- Drag/swipe/pinch/path gestures need tap/click and keyboard alternatives unless essential
- `autoFocus` sparingly—desktop only, single primary input; avoid on mobile

### Safe Areas & Layout

- Full-bleed layouts need `env(safe-area-inset-*)` for notches
- Avoid unwanted scrollbars: `overflow-x-hidden` on containers, fix content overflow
- Flex/grid over JS measurement for layout

### Dark Mode & Theming

- `color-scheme: dark` on `<html>` for dark themes (fixes scrollbar, inputs)
- `<meta name="theme-color">` matches page background
- Native `<select>`: explicit `background-color` and `color` (Windows dark mode)

### Locale & i18n

- Dates/times: use `Intl.DateTimeFormat` not hardcoded formats
- Numbers/currency: use `Intl.NumberFormat` not hardcoded formats
- Detect language via `Accept-Language` / `navigator.languages`, not IP
- Brand names, code tokens, identifiers: wrap with `translate="no"` to prevent garbled auto-translation

### Hydration Safety _(React / SSR frameworks only)_

- Inputs with `value` need `onChange` (or use `defaultValue` for uncontrolled)
- Date/time rendering: guard against hydration mismatch (server vs client)
- `suppressHydrationWarning` only where truly needed

### Hover & Interactive States

- Buttons/links need `hover:` state (visual feedback)
- Interactive states increase contrast: hover/active/focus more prominent than rest

### Content & Copy

- Active voice: "Install the CLI" not "The CLI will be installed"
- Title Case for headings/buttons (Chicago style)
- Numerals for counts: "8 deployments" not "eight"
- Specific button labels: "Save API Key" not "Continue"
- Error messages include fix/next step, not just problem
- Second person; avoid first person
- `&` over "and" where space-constrained

### Anti-patterns (flag these)

- `user-scalable=no` or `maximum-scale=1` disabling zoom
- `onPaste` with `preventDefault`
- `transition: all`
- `outline-none` without focus-visible replacement
- Inline `onClick` navigation without `<a>`
- `<div>` or `<span>` with click handlers (should be `<button>`)
- Images without dimensions
- Large arrays `.map()` without virtualization
- Form inputs without labels
- Icon buttons without `aria-label`
- Hardcoded date/number formats (use `Intl.*`)
- `autoFocus` without clear justification
- Animated GIF when compressed video is suitable
- Gesture-only action without tap/click and keyboard alternative

## Output Format

Group by file. Use `file:line` format (VS Code clickable). Terse findings.

```text
## src/Button.tsx

src/Button.tsx:42 - icon button missing aria-label
src/Button.tsx:18 - input lacks label
src/Button.tsx:55 - animation missing prefers-reduced-motion
src/Button.tsx:67 - transition: all → list properties

## src/Modal.tsx

src/Modal.tsx:12 - missing overscroll-behavior: contain
src/Modal.tsx:34 - "..." → "…"

## src/Card.tsx

✓ pass
```

State issue + location. Skip explanation unless fix non-obvious. No preamble.
