description: Decidable rules for UI animation and motion - whether something should animate at all (frequency gate), purpose, tool choice (CSS transition / @starting-style / WAAPI / Motion), GPU-only properties, strong custom easing curves, sub-300ms duration budgets, springs, interruptibility, transform-origin, reduced-motion and hover gating. Two modes - Build (write an animation that passes review first time) and Review (strict Before/After/Why findings with Block/Approve verdict). Use when adding or changing transitions, micro-interactions, toasts, drawers, popovers, page or scroll motion, or when asked to review/fix animation code or "make it feel polished". For scroll-driven GSAP/Motion section skeletons on landing pages use design-taste-frontend; for general UI code linting use web-interface-review; for product-UI visual hierarchy use interface-design.

# Motion Craft

> Adapted from [emilkowalski/skills](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills) (MIT, (c) 2026 Emil Kowalski) at commit `85e8e23`: the `animate` build sequence, the `review-animations` standards and output format, `STANDARDS.md`, and `RECIPES.md`. Changes: merged into one skill with two modes, removed the persona "Initial Response" and `disable-model-invocation` (so it triggers on motion work), and replaced links to upstream sibling skills.

Motion is the biggest gap between an interface that runs and one that feels right. This skill makes "feels polished" decidable: every animation has to pass a frequency gate, name a purpose, and use exact curves, durations and properties from [references/STANDARDS.md](references/STANDARDS.md) - never approximated values.

Two failure modes, and the first is worse:

1. **Animating something that shouldn't animate.** The gate below exists to produce zero lines of code sometimes. That's a success, not a dodge.
2. **Animating the right thing with the wrong ingredients** — `ease-in` on an entrance, `scale(0)`, keyframes on a toast, a duration that makes a dropdown feel sluggish.

**Pick the mode:**
- **Build** - the user asks to animate something, add motion, add a transition, or make a component feel alive. Make the call, state the reasoning in one line, write the code. Never present motion options as a menu.
- **Review** - the user asks to review, critique, audit or fix existing motion code, or a diff touches animation. Default to flagging; approval is earned.

**Reference files (load on demand):**
- [references/STANDARDS.md](references/STANDARDS.md) - the full rule catalog: frequency table, easing, duration, physicality, springs, interruptibility, asymmetric timing, performance, transforms & clip-path, gestures, blur, stagger, accessibility, debugging. Load whenever a value or citation is needed.
- [references/RECIPES.md](references/RECIPES.md) - ready-to-build button press, dropdown/popover, tooltip, modal, drawer, toast, accordion, stagger, hold-to-confirm, tab indicator, scroll reveal, drag-to-dismiss, crossfade masking, WAAPI. Start from the recipe when the request matches one.

## Build mode

### Hard Rules

1. **Run the sequence in order.** Steps 1 and 2 gate everything. Don't reach for a curve before you know whether it animates at all.
2. **No approximated values.** Every curve, duration, and spring config comes from the tables below. Never invent `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` because it looks familiar.
3. **Extend the codebase's tokens, don't fork them.** If `--ease-out` or a duration scale already exists, use it. Adding a parallel system is a defect.
4. **Reduced motion and hover gating ship with the animation**, not as a follow-up.
5. **Cheapest tool that works.** Don't install a motion library for a fade.

### The Build Sequence

#### 1. Should this animate at all?

| Frequency | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| 100+ times/day (keyboard shortcuts, command palette toggle) | **No animation. Ever.** Stop here. |
| Tens of times/day (hover effects, list navigation) | Near-imperceptible only — fast and subtle, or nothing |
| Occasional (modals, drawers, toasts) | Standard animation |
| Rare / first-time (onboarding, success, celebration) | The delight budget lives here |

**Keyboard-initiated actions are a disqualifier, not a judgment call.** Raycast has no open/close animation — that is correct for something opened hundreds of times a day.

If the request fails this gate, say so plainly and don't write the animation. Offer the non-motion alternative (instant state change, a static affordance) instead.

#### 2. What is the purpose?

Name it in one of these words before continuing:

- **Feedback** — confirming the interface heard the user
- **Spatial consistency** — showing where something came from or went
- **State indication** — making a state change legible
- **Preventing a jarring change** — bridging content that would otherwise teleport
- **Explanation** — demonstrating how something works (marketing/onboarding only)
- **Delight** — allowed *only* at the rare/first-time tier

Can't name it? Don't build it. "It looks cool" on a frequently-seen element is a reason to stop.

Also check **function**: data the user is reading or acting on should not move for style. A decorative mouse-tracking effect belongs on a marketing page, not on a graph in a banking app.

#### 3. Pick the tool — cheapest that works

Walk down; stop at the first that fits.

| Need | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| Hover, press, color, a state toggle you control with a class or attribute | **CSS transition** |
| Entry animation on mount, no JS state | **CSS `@starting-style`** |
| Predetermined motion that must stay smooth while the page is busy loading | **CSS animation** (runs off the main thread) |
| Programmatic control with CSS performance, no library | **WAAPI** (`element.animate()`) |
| Springs, layout animations, exit animations, gesture-driven values | **Motion** (`motion.dev`) |

CSS animations beat JS under load — they run off the main thread, while `requestAnimationFrame`-based animation drops frames while the browser loads, scripts, or paints. Use CSS for predetermined motion, JS for dynamic and interruptible motion.

If the task needs a *component* rather than an animation — a toast, a drawer, a command menu, a dropdown — stop and use the project's existing primitive or a battle-tested headless library (see "Use What Exists" in `interface-design`). Hand-rolling those is how you end up with a `<div>` dropdown and no focus management.

#### 4. Pick the properties

- **`transform` and `opacity` only.** They skip layout and paint and run on the GPU. `width`/`height`/`margin`/`padding`/`top`/`left` trigger all three. (`clip-path` is the sanctioned fourth — see [references/RECIPES.md](references/RECIPES.md). `height` is tolerated only for accordions, where there's no transform equivalent.)
- **Never `scale(0)`.** Start from `scale(0.9–0.97)` + `opacity: 0`. Nothing in the real world appears from nothing.
- **`transform-origin` at the trigger** for popovers, dropdowns, menus, tooltips — `var(--transform-origin)` in Base UI. **Modals are exempt**; they're not anchored to a trigger, so they stay centered.
- **Percentages in `translate()`** are relative to the element's own size — `translateY(100%)` moves by its own height whatever the content. Prefer over hardcoded pixels.
- **In Motion, use the full transform string.** `x`/`y`/`scale` shorthands are not hardware-accelerated and drop frames under load:

```jsx
<motion.div animate={{ x: 100 }} />                          // drops frames under load
<motion.div animate={{ transform: "translateX(100px)" }} />  // hardware accelerated
```

- **Never drive a child's transform from a CSS variable on the parent** — it recalculates styles for every child. Set `transform` on the element directly.

#### 5. Easing and duration — or a spring

**Easing**, in decision order:

| Situation | Easing |
| --- | --- |
| Entering or exiting | `ease-out` |
| Moving / morphing on screen | `ease-in-out` |
| Hover / color change | `ease` |
| Constant motion (marquee, progress) | `linear` |
| Default | `ease-out` |

**Never `ease-in` on UI.** It starts slow, delaying the exact moment the user is watching. `ease-out` at 200ms *feels* faster than `ease-in` at 200ms.

Built-in CSS easings are too weak. Use these:

```css
--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1);        /* strong ease-out for UI */
--ease-in-out: cubic-bezier(0.77, 0, 0.175, 1);    /* strong ease-in-out for on-screen movement */
--ease-drawer: cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1);     /* iOS-like drawer curve (Ionic) */
```

Need a curve that isn't here? Take it from [easing.dev](https://easing.dev/) or [easings.co](https://easings.co/). Don't hand-roll one.

**Duration:**

| Element | Duration |
| --- | --- |
| Button press feedback | 100–160ms |
| Tooltips, small popovers | 125–200ms |
| Dropdowns, selects | 150–250ms |
| Modals, drawers | 200–500ms |
| Marketing / explanatory | Can be longer |

**UI animations stay under 300ms.** A 180ms dropdown feels more responsive than a 400ms one.

**Reach for a spring instead** when the motion is drag with momentum, an element that should feel alive, a gesture the user can interrupt or reverse, or decorative mouse-tracking:

```js
{ type: "spring", duration: 0.5, bounce: 0.2 }        // Apple-style — easier to reason about
{ type: "spring", mass: 1, stiffness: 100, damping: 10 }  // traditional physics — more control
```

Keep bounce at 0.1–0.3, and avoid bounce in most UI — reserve it for drag-to-dismiss and playful interactions.

#### 6. Interruption and exit

- **Transitions, not keyframes, for anything triggered rapidly** — toasts, toggles, anything a user can fire twice in a second. Transitions retarget from the current value; keyframes restart from zero.
- **Springs for gestures**, because they carry velocity through an interruption.
- **Exit the way it entered.** A toast that slides in from the bottom leaves through the bottom. Symmetric paths are what make swipe-to-dismiss feel obvious.
- **Asymmetric timing where the user is deciding.** Slow on the deliberate phase (a hold-to-confirm press: 2s linear), snappy on the system response (release: 200ms ease-out).

#### 7. Reduced motion and pointer gating

Ships with the animation, every time.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .element { animation: fade 0.2s ease; } /* keep opacity/color, drop transform-based motion */
}

@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
  .element:hover { transform: scale(1.05); } /* touch fires false hovers on tap */
}
```

```jsx
const reduce = useReducedMotion();
const closedX = reduce ? 0 : '-100%';
```

Reduced motion means **fewer and gentler** animations, not zero — keep transitions that aid comprehension, remove movement and position changes.

### Never Ship

Self-check before you finish. Each of these is an automatic **Block** in Review mode below:

| Never | Instead |
| --- | --- |
| `transition: all` | Name the exact properties |
| `transform: scale(0)` entrance | `scale(0.95)` + `opacity: 0` |
| `ease-in` on a UI element | `ease-out` or a strong custom curve |
| Built-in `ease-out` on a deliberate animation | `cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)` |
| Animation on a keyboard shortcut or 100+/day action | No animation |
| UI duration over 300ms with no reason | 150–250ms |
| `transform-origin: center` on a trigger-anchored popover | `var(--transform-origin)` (modals exempt) |
| Keyframes on toasts, toggles, rapidly-triggered elements | CSS transitions |
| Animating `width`/`height`/`margin`/`padding`/`top`/`left` | `transform` / `opacity` |
| Motion `x`/`y`/`scale` props under load | Full `transform` string |
| Ungated `:hover` motion | `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` |
| Missing `prefers-reduced-motion` | Gentler variant, not zero |
| Everything entering at once | 30–80ms stagger |

### Build output

Write the code. Then, in at most a few lines:

- **The gate result** — frequency tier and the named purpose. If something in the request was rejected, say which and why.
- **The ingredients** — tool, properties, curve, duration or spring config, in one line each.
- **What to feel-check** — if the result depends on feel you can't judge from code (a crossfade, a spring's bounce, the opacity/height balance in an entering list), say so and point at the check: play it at 2–5× duration or in the DevTools animation inspector, step it frame by frame, test gestures on a real device, and look again the next day with fresh eyes.

Don't pad this into a report. The code is the deliverable.

## Review mode

A review looks only at animation and motion code. It does not write features, fix unrelated bugs, or review non-motion code (use `web-interface-review` or a general code review for that).

### The Ten Non-Negotiable Standards

Every animation in the diff is measured against these. A violation is a finding.

1. **Justified motion.** Every animation must answer "why does this animate?" — spatial consistency, state indication, feedback, explanation, or preventing a jarring change. "It looks cool" on a frequently-seen element is a block.

2. **Frequency-appropriate.** Match motion to how often it's seen. Keyboard-initiated and 100+/day actions get **no** animation. Tens/day gets reduced motion. Occasional gets standard. Rare/first-time can have delight.

3. **Responsive easing.** Entering/exiting elements use `ease-out` or a strong custom curve. `ease-in` on UI is a block — it delays the moment the user watches most. Built-in CSS easings are too weak; expect custom cubic-beziers.

4. **Sub-300ms UI.** UI animations stay under 300ms; anything slower on a UI element needs justification or it's a finding. Per-element budgets live in [references/STANDARDS.md](references/STANDARDS.md).

5. **Origin & physical correctness.** Popovers/dropdowns/tooltips scale from their trigger (`transform-origin`), not center. Never animate from `scale(0)` — start from `scale(0.9–0.97)` + opacity (Modals are exempt — they stay centered.)

6. **Interruptibility.** Rapidly-triggered or gesture-driven motion (toasts, toggles, drags) must be interruptible — CSS transitions or springs that retarget from current state, not keyframes that restart from zero.

7. **GPU-only properties.** Animate `transform` and `opacity` only. Animating `width`/`height`/`margin`/`padding`/`top`/`left` (or Framer Motion `x`/`y`/`scale` shorthands under load) is a performance finding.

8. **Accessibility.** `prefers-reduced-motion` is honored (gentler, not zero — keep opacity/color, drop movement). Hover animations are gated behind `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)`.

9. **Asymmetric enter/exit.** Deliberate actions (a press, a hold, a destructive confirm) animate slower; system responses snap. Symmetric timing on a press-and-release or hold interaction is a finding.

10. **Cohesion.** Motion matches the component's personality and the rest of the product — playful can be bouncier, a dashboard stays crisp. Mismatched personality, or a jarring crossfade where a subtle blur would bridge two states, is a finding. When unsure whether motion feels right, the strongest move is often to delete it.

### Aggressive Escalation Triggers

Flag these on sight, hard:

- `transition: all` (unbounded property animation)
- `scale(0)` or pure-fade entrances with no initial transform
- `ease-in` on any UI interaction; weak built-in easing on a deliberate animation
- Animation on a keyboard shortcut, command-palette toggle, or 100+/day action
- UI duration > 300ms with no stated reason
- `transform-origin: center` on a trigger-anchored popover/dropdown/tooltip
- Keyframes on toasts, toggles, or anything added/triggered rapidly
- Animating layout properties (`width`/`height`/`margin`/`padding`/`top`/`left`)
- Framer Motion `x`/`y`/`scale` props on motion that runs while the page is busy
- Updating a CSS variable on a parent to drive a child transform (style recalc storm)
- Missing `prefers-reduced-motion` handling on movement
- Ungated `:hover` motion
- Symmetric enter/exit timing on a press-and-release or hold interaction
- Everything-at-once entrance where a 30–80ms stagger belongs

### Remedial Preference Hierarchy

When proposing fixes, prefer earlier moves over later ones:

1. **Delete the animation** (high-frequency / no purpose / keyboard-triggered).
2. **Reduce it** — shorter duration, smaller transform, fewer animated properties.
3. **Fix the easing** — swap `ease-in`→`ease-out`/custom curve; use a strong cubic-bezier.
4. **Fix the origin/physicality** — correct `transform-origin`; replace `scale(0)` with `scale(0.95)`+opacity.
5. **Make it interruptible** — keyframes → transitions, or a spring for gesture-driven motion.
6. **Move it to the GPU** — layout props → `transform`/`opacity`; shorthand → full `transform` string; WAAPI for programmatic CSS.
7. **Asymmetric timing** — slow the deliberate phase, snap the response.
8. **Polish** — blur to mask crossfades, stagger for groups, `@starting-style` for entry, spring for "alive" elements.
9. **Accessibility & cohesion** — add reduced-motion + hover gating; tune to match the component's personality.

### Required Output Format

Two parts, in this order.

#### Part 1 — Findings table (REQUIRED)

A single markdown table. One row per issue. Never a "Before:/After:" list.

| Before | After | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `transition: all 300ms` | `transition: transform 200ms ease-out` | Specify exact properties; `all` animates unintended properties off-GPU |
| `transform: scale(0)` | `transform: scale(0.95); opacity: 0` | Nothing appears from nothing — `scale(0)` looks like it came from nowhere |
| `ease-in` on dropdown | `ease-out` + custom curve | `ease-in` delays the moment the user watches most; feels sluggish |
| `transform-origin: center` on popover | `var(--transform-origin)` (Base UI) | Popovers scale from their trigger, not center (modals are exempt) |

#### Part 2 — Verdict (REQUIRED)

Group remaining commentary by impact tier, highest first. Omit empty tiers.

1. **Feel-breaking regressions** — sluggish easing, comes-from-nowhere, fires on high-frequency/keyboard actions.
2. **Missed simplifications** — animations that should be removed or drastically reduced.
3. **Performance** — non-GPU properties, dropped-frame risks, recalc storms.
4. **Interruptibility & timing** — keyframes where transitions/springs belong; symmetric timing that should be asymmetric.
5. **Origin, physicality & cohesion** — wrong origin, mismatched personality, jarring crossfades.
6. **Accessibility** — reduced-motion and pointer/hover gating.

Close with an explicit decision:

- **Block** — any feel-breaking regression, animation on a keyboard/high-frequency action, `scale(0)`/`ease-in` on UI, or a non-GPU animation with an easy GPU fix.
- **Approve** — no feel-breaking regressions, no obvious motion that should be deleted, durations and easing within bounds, interruptibility handled where needed, reduced-motion respected.

Be specific and cite `file:line`. When a value is needed (a curve, a duration, a spring config), pull the exact one from [references/STANDARDS.md](references/STANDARDS.md) rather than approximating.

### Guidelines

- Prefer CSS transitions/`@starting-style`/WAAPI for predetermined motion; JS/springs for dynamic, interruptible, gesture-driven motion.
- When unsure whether motion feels right, recommend reviewing it in slow motion / frame-by-frame and with fresh eyes the next day rather than guessing.

---

## Tone (both modes)

Opinionated and brief. When the honest answer is "this shouldn't animate," give it — that answer is the reason this skill exists. When feel genuinely can't be settled from code, say so instead of guessing at a value.
