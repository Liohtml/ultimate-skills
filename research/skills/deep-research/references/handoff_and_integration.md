# Deep Research — Handoff, Integration and Model Tiering

## Handoff Protocol: deep-research → academic-paper

After research is complete, the following materials can be handed off to `academic-paper`:

1. **Research Question Brief** (from research_question_agent)
2. **Methodology Blueprint** (from research_architect_agent)
3. **Annotated Bibliography** (from bibliography_agent)
4. **Synthesis Report** (from synthesis_agent)
5. **[If socratic mode] INSIGHT Collection and Research Plan Summary**
6. **Preregistration handoff** — exactly one builder-produced
   `preregistration-artifact/1.0` sidecar (including an unavailable receipt) and,
   when `status=provided`, its explicitly named companion bytes

**Trigger**: User says "now help me write a paper" or "write a paper based on this"

`academic-paper`'s `intake_agent` will automatically detect available materials and skip redundant steps:
- Has RQ Brief -> skip topic scoping
- Has Bibliography -> skip literature search
- Has Synthesis -> accelerate findings / discussion writing
- Has preregistration sidecar -> strict-validate it and its named companion,
  then carry both byte-for-byte; never rebuild it from prose or a template

The non-shell `research_architect_agent` supplies only the explicit caller
declaration and companion handle. Before handoff, a shell-capable dispatcher
must run the named deterministic `build-preregistration-artifact` subcommand in
`scripts/build_cross_document_consistency_advisory.py`, with caller-held RFC3339
`declared_at`. Only that builder may create or update the sidecar. A later
explicit user supply creates a new builder-produced sidecar; omission or silent
substitution is invalid.

See `examples/handoff_to_paper.md` for a detailed handoff example.

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill is domain-agnostic but can be combined with domain-specific skills:

```
deep-research + tw-hei-intelligence     -> Evidence-based HEI policy research
deep-research + report-to-website       -> Interactive research report
deep-research + podcast-script-generator -> Research podcast
deep-research + academic-paper          -> Full research-to-publication pipeline
deep-research (socratic) + academic-paper (plan) -> Guided research + paper planning
deep-research (systematic-review) + academic-paper -> PRISMA systematic review paper
```

## Model Tiering (#517, optional)

When `ARS_MODEL_TIERING` is set, the dispatching session routes this skill's agents per `shared/model_tiering.md` (canonical: the full 39-agent judgment/execution table + rules). Compact rule:

- **Unset (default):** every agent inherits the session model — byte-equivalent pre-#517 behavior.
- **`economy`** (frontier-tier session): execution-type agents dispatch ONE tier below the session model — floor Opus-class, never lower; judgment-type agents stay on the session model. No-op at or below the floor (announce once).
- **`quality-boost`** (below-frontier session): judgment-type agents at the checkpoint surfaces (Stage 2.5/4.5 gates; the opt-in Stage 4→5 claim–ref audit; final review) jump UP to the frontier tier (however many tiers away — not a single increment); nothing is ever downgraded. No-op at the frontier (announce once).
- Unknown values → warn once, behave as unset. Tiers are relative positions, never hard-pinned model ids. When a direction is active, route repeated same-stage calls to the SAME worker so its prompt cache accumulates; unset means dispatch shapes stay byte-equivalent too.
