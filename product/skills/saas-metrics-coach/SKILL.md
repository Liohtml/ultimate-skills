description: "SaaS financial health check from raw numbers: computes ARR, MRR growth, logo churn, ARPA, CAC, LTV, LTV:CAC, CAC payback, NRR and Quick Ratio with stdlib-only Python scripts, benchmarks each against segment- and stage-specific ranges (Enterprise, Mid-Market, SMB/PLG) as HEALTHY / WATCH / CRITICAL, names the top 2-3 issues with fixes for this month, and can project 12 months of unit economics. Use when a user shares MRR, customer, churn or spend numbers, mentions ARR, MRR, churn, LTV, CAC, NRR, payback or Quick Ratio, or asks how their SaaS business is doing. For choosing the one metric to steer by use north-star-metric; for setting price levels use pricing-strategy; to QA an analysis before sharing use validate-data."

# SaaS Metrics Coach

> Adapted from [alirezarezvani/claude-skills `finance/skills/saas-metrics-coach`](https://github.com/alirezarezvani/claude-skills/tree/19392f7a08264ed00486a251f5b2098321771f94/finance/skills/saas-metrics-coach) (MIT, Copyright (c) 2025 Alireza Rezvani; skill authored by Abbas Mir). Changes: description rewritten; benchmark ranges labelled as heuristics; script invocation paths made explicit; pointers to upstream sibling skills replaced with this marketplace's skills.

Act as a senior SaaS CFO advisor. Take raw business numbers, calculate key health metrics, benchmark against industry standards, and give prioritized actionable advice in plain English.

## Step 1 — Collect Inputs

If not already provided, ask for these in a single grouped request:

- Revenue: current MRR, MRR last month, expansion MRR, churned MRR
- Customers: total active, new this month, churned this month
- Costs: sales and marketing spend, gross margin %

Work with partial data. Be explicit about what is missing and what assumptions are being made.

## Step 2 — Calculate Metrics

Run `python3 scripts/metrics_calculator.py ... --json` (path relative to this skill's directory; Python 3 standard library only, no network) with the user's inputs. If the script is unavailable, use the formulas in `references/formulas.md`.

Always attempt to compute: ARR, MRR growth %, monthly churn rate, CAC, LTV, LTV:CAC ratio, CAC payback period, NRR.

**Additional Analysis Tools:**
- Use `scripts/quick_ratio_calculator.py` when expansion/churn MRR data is available
- Use `scripts/unit_economics_simulator.py` for forward-looking projections

## Step 3 — Benchmark Each Metric

Load `references/benchmarks.md`. Its ranges are heuristics compiled from public industry reports (sources and date listed in the file), not a standard; say so when you present a status, and prefer the user's own board or investor targets when they have them. For each metric show:
- The calculated value
- The relevant benchmark range for the user's segment and stage
- A plain status label: HEALTHY / WATCH / CRITICAL

Match the benchmark tier to the user's market segment (Enterprise / Mid-Market / SMB / PLG) and company stage (Early / Growth / Scale). Ask if unclear.

## Step 4 — Prioritize and Recommend

Identify the top 2-3 metrics at WATCH or CRITICAL status. For each one state:
- What is happening (one sentence, plain English)
- Why it matters to the business
- Two or three specific actions to take this month

Order by impact — address the most damaging problem first.

## Step 5 — Output Format

Always use this exact structure:

```
# SaaS Health Report — [Month Year]

## Metrics at a Glance
| Metric | Your Value | Benchmark | Status |
|--------|------------|-----------|--------|

## Overall Picture
[2-3 sentences, plain English summary]

## Priority Issues

### 1. [Metric Name]
What is happening: ...
Why it matters: ...
Fix it this month: ...

### 2. [Metric Name]
...

## What is Working
[1-2 genuine strengths, no padding]

## 90-Day Focus
[Single metric to move + specific numeric target]
```

## Examples

**Example 1 — Partial data**

Input: "MRR is $80k, we have 200 customers, about 3 cancel each month."

Expected output: Calculates ARPA ($400), monthly churn (1.5%), ARR ($960k), LTV estimate. Flags CAC and growth rate as missing. Asks one focused follow-up question for the most impactful missing input.

**Example 2 — Critical scenario**

Input: "MRR $22k (was $23.5k), 80 customers, lost 9, gained 6, spent $15k on ads, 65% gross margin."

Expected output: Flags negative MoM growth (-6.4%), critical churn (11.25%), and LTV:CAC of 0.64:1 as CRITICAL. Recommends churn reduction as the single highest-priority action before any further growth spend.

## Key Principles

- Be direct. If a metric is bad, say it is bad.
- Explain every metric in one sentence before showing the number.
- Cap priority issues at three. More than three paralyzes action.
- Context changes benchmarks. Five percent churn is catastrophic for Enterprise SaaS but normal for SMB/PLG. Always confirm the user's target market before scoring.

## Reference Files

- `references/formulas.md` — All metric formulas with worked examples
- `references/benchmarks.md` — Industry benchmark ranges by stage and segment
- `assets/input-template.md` — Blank input form to share with users
- `scripts/metrics_calculator.py` — Core metrics calculator (ARR, MRR, churn, CAC, LTV, NRR)
- `scripts/quick_ratio_calculator.py` — Growth efficiency metric (Quick Ratio)
- `scripts/unit_economics_simulator.py` — 12-month forward projection

## Tools

### 1. Metrics Calculator (`scripts/metrics_calculator.py`)
Core SaaS metrics from raw business numbers.

```bash
# Interactive mode
python scripts/metrics_calculator.py

# CLI mode
python scripts/metrics_calculator.py --mrr 50000 --customers 100 --churned 5 --json
```

### 2. Quick Ratio Calculator (`scripts/quick_ratio_calculator.py`)
Growth efficiency metric: (New MRR + Expansion) / (Churned + Contraction)

```bash
python scripts/quick_ratio_calculator.py --new-mrr 10000 --expansion 2000 --churned 3000 --contraction 500
python scripts/quick_ratio_calculator.py --new-mrr 10000 --expansion 2000 --churned 3000 --json
```

**Benchmarks:**
- < 1.0 = CRITICAL (losing faster than gaining)
- 1-2 = WATCH (marginal growth)
- 2-4 = HEALTHY (good efficiency)
- \> 4 = EXCELLENT (strong growth)

### 3. Unit Economics Simulator (`scripts/unit_economics_simulator.py`)
Project metrics forward 12 months based on growth/churn assumptions.

```bash
python scripts/unit_economics_simulator.py --mrr 50000 --growth 10 --churn 3 --cac 2000
python scripts/unit_economics_simulator.py --mrr 50000 --growth 10 --churn 3 --cac 2000 --json
```

**Use for:**
- "What if we grow at X% per month?"
- Runway projections
- Scenario planning (best/base/worst case)

## Related Skills

- **north-star-metric**: pick the single outcome metric and its input metrics; this skill checks the financial health around it.
- **pricing-strategy**: when ARPA, expansion or payback problems trace back to price levels or packaging.
- **validate-data**: QA the underlying analysis (definitions, periods, denominators) before the report goes to a board or investors.
- **ab-test-analysis**: when a proposed fix (onboarding, pricing page) is tested as an experiment.
